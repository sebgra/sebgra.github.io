### Leading "Jeunes Bioinformaticiens de France" (2022-2024)


More information about **JeBiF**  [here](../files/JOBIM_2024_poster-pdf_133.pdf)

During my two-year term as President of **Jeunes Bioinformaticiens de France** (*JeBiF*), I leveraged my strategic leadership and organizational capabilities to transform and expand the association’s national impact, directly supporting France’s emerging Bioinformatics talent.

- <u>Strategic Leadership & Talent Structuring </u>: I initiated and led efforts to structure and energize France's emerging Bioinformatics talent, defining the organization's strategic roadmap.

- <u>Fundraising & Strategic Partnerships </u>: I managed the process of securing financial resources needed to prepare and organize our activities. I coordinated key national and international collaborations, significantly expanding the networking and reach of the Bioinformatics community.

- <u>Outreach & Public Engagement </u>: I directed the association in its actions to promote and popularize the field of Bioinformatics to public, private, and academic stakeholders.

 - Example: Oversaw the organization of an outreach booth designed to introduce children to the field of science through Bioinformatics at the [**Science Day in Paris**](https://jebif.fr/events/fete-de-la-science-2024/).

- <u>Event Management & Technical Training </u>: I supervised the logistics and execution of major nationwide community-building events and technical workshops focused on reproducibility.

  - Examples: Successfully launched a series of Bioinformatics Afterworks [JeBif Pub](https://jebif.fr/2023/06/jebif-pub-jobim-2023/) across France and ran a DevOps/MLOps Workshop on reproducibility for the [**JOBIM 2024** French conference](https://jebif.fr/evenements/jebif-workshop/jobim-2024-toulouse/).
