I'm a Bioinformatics & AI specialist driven by the power of computational methods to decode complex biology, with a particular focus on personalized medicine and drug discovery. My work at the Pasteur Institute led to Hicberg (genomics tool, publication coming soon!). 

Currently, I'm applying and seeking to understand AI models for omics data to advance therapeutics and diagnostics.
